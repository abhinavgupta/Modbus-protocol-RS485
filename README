1 - Open either sketch on your Arduino IDE:
	- mbslave_pde_example.pde is programed in C. The complete modbus implementation is inside the sketch. Nothing else is needed.
	- mbslave_lib_example.pde uses the ModbusSlave library. The library is included in this directory as the directory ModbusSlave. See Arduino 		  library reference on the internet to see how to install the library. 
	
2 - upload your selected sketch into your arduino.

3 - on your linux console, change to the directory where you unpacked mbslave_examples.tar.gz file, and type:
make
this will create the Modbus master file mbm. 

4 - Run the executable:
./mbm

You will see the led of your arduino turn off (if it was on), then turn on
for 2 seconds, then blink quite fast for 3 secs, and then blink slower for
6 seconds.

You can of course use other Modbus master implementations for your test.

Other things to be noticed is the PDE Sketches folder. This is version 1.0 implementation of MODBUS protocol. The c file in the folder can be used with certain modifications as a universal file that can run on virutally any microcontroller.
